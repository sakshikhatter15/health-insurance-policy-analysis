## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyses the **Australian Private Hospital Insurance (PHI) market**, focusing on whether the market is in decline and evaluating **government policy interventions** using economic theory, empirical data, and comparative statics.

The analysis combines:
- Real-world regulatory data (APRA)
- Market equilibrium theory
- Health economics literature
- Policy impact evaluation frameworks

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Empirically investigate whether Australia’s PHI market is declining  
2. Analyse the impact of **COVID-19** on insurance coverage, premiums, and policy types  
3. Critically evaluate **three government policy responses** using:
   - Supply & demand theory
   - Market equilibrium shifts
   - Elasticity estimates
4. Recommend optimal policy actions to ensure **high-quality healthcare at the lowest cost**

## 📊 Data Sources

- **APRA – Operations of Private Health Insurers Annual Reports (2018–2023)**
- Australian health economics literature
- Government policy documentation

Key variables analysed:
- Average out-of-pocket payments
- Hospital coverage by age group
- Policy types (exclusionary vs comprehensive)
- Post-COVID behavioural changes

---

## 🔍 Key Findings

- The claim that the PHI market is declining is **rejected**
- Overall policy uptake increased post-COVID, despite:
  - Declines among younger age groups
  - Growth in exclusionary and high-excess policies
- Average patient payments rose significantly post-pandemic
- Older age groups maintained or increased PHI coverage

## 🏛 Policy Analysis

### **Policy Response 1: Age-Based Subsidies**
- Increases PHI uptake among younger individuals
- Helps prevent adverse selection and “death spiral”
- Moderate impact due to inelastic demand (elasticity ≈ −0.3 to −0.4)

### **Policy Response 2: Lower Medicare Levy Surcharge Threshold**
- Strong incentive for middle-income earners to purchase PHI
- Demand curve shifts right
- Empirically supported by regression discontinuity studies

### **Policy Response 3: Reduce Cost of Medical Equipment**
- Lowers healthcare production costs
- Supply curve shifts right → lower premiums
- Benefits both insurers and consumers

## 🧠 Analytical Methods Used

- **Comparative statics**
- **Difference-in-Differences (DiD)**
- **Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD)**
- **Instrumental Variables (IV)**
- Supply & demand equilibrium modelling

Hand-drawn and computer-generated diagrams were used to illustrate market shifts.

## 🏆 Final Recommendation

A **combined policy approach** is recommended:

- Lower the Medicare Levy Surcharge threshold
- Implement regulatory reforms to reduce medical equipment costs  

This dual strategy:
- Increases affordability
- Expands PHI uptake
- Reduces strain on public healthcare
- Achieves policy goals at minimal economic cost
